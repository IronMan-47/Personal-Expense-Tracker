# Student-Expense-Tracker
This Python CLI tracks daily expenses. It auto-saves to CSV, supports editing, and calculates spending totals by category.
I essentially created this Python script to help me monitor my everyday spending since I wanted something straightforward that could be executed in the terminal. It is divided into two files: Modules2.py conducts the hard lifting, such as data storage, while the main file manages the menu. I don't lose my records because it automatically saves everything in a CSV file. I configured it so that each item has a unique ID, which makes it much simpler to subsequently correct errors or remove items. To see where the money is really going, there's also a quick way to view overall spending by category. Installation is not required because it only makes use of standard libraries.
